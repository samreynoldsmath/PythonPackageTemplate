# pip does not install dependencies

## Steps to reproduce
1. Create a new virtual environment
   ```bash
   mkdir test-example-package-samreynoldsmath
   virtualenv -p python3 test-example-package-samreynoldsmath
   cd test-example-package-samreynoldsmath
   source bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the package from `test.pypi.org`
   ```bash
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ example-package-samreynoldsmath==0.1.9
   ```

## Expected result
The package is installed and the only dependency, `numpy`, is also installed.

## Actual result
The package begins to install, but fails with the following error:
```bash
Looking in indexes: https://test.pypi.org/simple/
Collecting example-package-samreynoldsmath==0.1.9
  Downloading https://test-files.pythonhosted.org/packages/74/ca/21f6e025838ded09aadf642caacb866e60575e8d2b7461a049d58aac0d98/example_package_samreynoldsmath-0.1.9-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (912 bytes)
INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of example-package-samreynoldsmath to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement numpy>=1.24.0 (from example-package-samreynoldsmath) (from versions: 1.9.3)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for numpy>=1.24.0
```

## Additional information

### System information
- OS: Ubuntu 23.10
- Python: 3.11.6
- pip: 24.0
- virtualenv 20.24.1+ds

### `numpy` version
At the time of writing, the most current version of `numpy` is 1.26.4.

### Preinstalling `numpy` before installing `example-package-samreynoldsmath` results in a successful installation
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ example-package-samreynoldsmath==0.1.9
pip list
```
Results in:
```bash
Package                         Version
------------------------------- -------
example_package_samreynoldsmath 0.1.9
numpy                           1.26.4
pip                             24.0
setuptools                      69.2.0
wheel                           0.43.0
```
This suggests that the issue is not that of the dependency itself, but rather that `pip` is not installing the dependency `numpy` when installing the package `example-package-samreynoldsmath`.
